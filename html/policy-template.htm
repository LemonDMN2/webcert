<h3>CA Policy</h3>

<h4>Certification Practise Statement (CPS)</h4>
<p>
This is a experimental CA for demonstration and educational
purposes only. There is no warranty that this software and
generated certificates work. Generated certificates do not
imply any ownership verifications and have no other link
to the author except through the public access to the auto-
generation with this software. Requests are signed in an
automated fashion.  Future certificate retrieval  or site
availability is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
I'm not responsible for misuse or missrepresentation.
This is NOT a classified CA.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the software does not manage a signed certificate
database. No CRL's are generated or updated. A copy of the
certificate is saved on this server.
