    <h3>2012-10-08 new version 1.7.5 released</h3>

      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>2011-06-20 new version 1.7.4 released</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
A html graphics layout overhaul has been done to better utilise external stylesheets.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>2010-11-10 new version 1.7.3 released</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
  Implementation of "Extended Key Usage" parameter to allow the creation
  of certificates that require it.  I needed it to generate certificates
  for Microsoft Windows to enable the active directory LDAPS function by
  adding the "SSL/TLS Web Server Authentication" extended key usage.
  At this time, only the extension values below have been implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>serverAuth,      SSL/TLS Web Server Authentication OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1</li>
      <li>clientAuth,      SSL/TLS Web Client Authentication OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2</li>
      <li>codeSigning,     Code signing                      OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3</li>
      <li>emailProtection, E-mail Protection (S/MIME)        OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4</li>
      <li>timeStamping,    Trusted Timestamping              OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8</li>
      <li>ocspSigning,     Online Cert Status Protocol signing OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
  I did not implement the OID's 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.5-7. They belong to id-kp-ipsecEndSystem,
  id-kp-ipsecTunnel and id-kp-ipsecUser and are reported to be obsolete
  as per RFC 4945 section 5.1.3.12,  "ExtendedKeyUsage".
    <p>
  Regardless what the certificate request contains, the extended key usage
  must be always explicitly set at the request verification screen to be
  included in the certificate. Even if a externally generated request did
  not add this attribute, it can be set additionally with WebCert.

    <h3>2008-03-20 	new version 1.7.2 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>Bug Fix:</h4>
    <p>
- The nasty P12 export function still created a empty zero byte p12 file
  in cases when no private key was paste'd at all. I also added an extra
  comment that the private key file is really needed for pkcs12 export.
    <p>
    <p>
    <h3>2007-12-20 	new version 1.7.1 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>Bug fix only:</h4>
    <p>
- The P12 export function failed when a private key was paste'd with
  multiple trailing empty lines, creating a empty zero byte p12 file.
    <p>
- A link to a S/Mime certificate creation How-To was added to help.
    <p>
    <h3>2007-12-15 	new version 1.7.0 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
- Full support for generation of S/MIME certificates
    <p>
- the new certexport.cgi convienently converts a existing PEM certificate
  into either DER or PKCS12 format. The files are copied into the export
  directory of the webcert web application.  In the case of PKCS12, the
  private key must be supplied in PEM format (cut&paste), together with a
  passphrase for protection.
    <p>
- the certsearch.cgi function has been expanded to filter certificates by
  their serial number
    <p>
    <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
    <p>
- The <Go Back> button in genrequest.cgi was pointing to certrequest.cgi
  instead of refering back to buildrequest.cgi.
    <p>
- the latest CGI were missing in the top level Makefile
    <p>
- the REQLEN parameter was to small for certificates with a 4096 bit key.
    <p>
- getcert.cgi had a minor display bug in the HTML table
    <p>
    <h3>2007-10-15 	new version 1.6.0 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
- to find particular certificates, the new certsearch CGI can filter
  the cert store per subject field, validation or expiration date.
  This helps to identify certificates that are about to expire,
  and renew them before they become invalid.
    <p>
    <p>
- set font to Arial in certverify.cgi and genrequest.cgi for consistent
  look and feel across CGI's.
    <p>
    <h3>2007-07-01 	new version 1.5.0 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
- certstore.cgi gets a new column, displaying how long the certificate is
  still valid. It is shown in days remaining and as a pseudo-graphical bar
  representing the percentage of time left, compared to the certificate
  lifetime. The selection to display a certificate either in PEM or TXT
  format has been added to certstore.cgi for quicker access.
    <p>
    <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
    <p>
- certstore.cgi display fails to sort correctly if store has more then
  255 certificate files because alphasort fails when the .pem filename
  gets the next 2 digits added after FF.pem is reached (255).
  I wrote hexsort to correct that.
    <p>
- fixed a minor display bug on the control panel in certstore.cgi, which
  is visible in konqueror. Improved pixel count for displaying the bar.
    <p>
- fixed wrong page count for certstore.cgi. When the number of certs is
  divisible through the max. entries per page without remainder,
  meaning that all pages are filled to the max, a extra empty page was
  generated.
    <p>
- compiler warnings complain about pointer targets differ in signedness:
  new compilers are so picky and warn about implicit data type promotion.
  I added explicit casting to avoid these errors.
    <p>
    <h3>2006-02-10      new version 1.4.0 released</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
- certificate options can be set: Client, Server, Signing, E-Mail,
  Expiration ...
    <p>
  Expiration is a most convenient feature. Usually certificates
  are valid several years. IF you want to experiment with short
  validity, set days to 1.
  Further visions: Imagine you want to give access to a
  resource using a client certificate that should expire with the
  end of a contract at a certain date. How about being able to 
  enter a start and end date similar to 'openssl ca -startdate -enddate'?
    <p>
- Expired certificates are marked red in the list by comparing their
  expiration date to the date of the webcert host.
    <p>
- webcert verified to work with openssl-0.9.8a
    <p>
    <h3>2005-06-25 	new version 1.3.0 released	</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h4>New functionality:</h4>
    <p>
- Implementation of the serial number management is the base for further
  improvements:
    <p>
	* certificates are not just displayed but also saved in the
          /certs directory. The serial number serves as the file name
          in tradition with identical OpenSSL behaviour.
    <p>
	* new certificate requests are generated with buildrequest.cgi
          and genrequest.cgi, then forwarded for immediate signing.
    <p>
        * buildrequest.cgi is now the new entry page while certrequest.cgi
          which handles paste of existing PEM requests, got a new menu item
          on the top menu.
    <p>
- certstore.cgi has been re-written to display the certificates sorted by
  creation time. Latest certs now appear first by default and it can be
  switched to show oldest first, also.
    <p>
    <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>
    <p>
- certstore.cgi fails when certs are available in the certs directory,
  but the webserver has no rights to read it. Fix: When a cert is not
  readable, it is marked as not readable in the list.
    <p>
- Having a extra newline at the end of a cut-&-paste certificate request
  results in a BEGIN/END lines error. Now the additional newline will
  be stripped off in certverify.cgi and certsign.cgi.
